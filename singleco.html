                Reading other writers’ work is one way to nurture your own writer's brain.
                
                Read often, and read different types of content. Making a habit of reading will expose you to different styles of writing and ways of structuring your content, which will benefit your own pieces.
                
                Josh Krissansen, managing director at copywriting company Lowercase (bloggerboy), says:
                
                    Read a ton. Reading fiction will help writers learn about narrative structure, while non-fiction from celebrated authors can give lessons on writing concisely and clearly.

                Read content from different brands and media publications you’re interested in or that are related to your industry, and consider setting up Google Alerts for the topics you write about.
                
                Monitoring your competitors and other industry leaders is also a good idea. After all, analyzing your competition can help boost your own content marketing.
                
                For example, you can also easily find the top-performing organic content of any website using the Organic Research Tool. Simply enter the domain and head to the “Pages” report to see what’s most popular on a website.
                Finding the best pages on other websites
                
                By critically evaluating the competing content, you can determine what works well and what can be improved. </p>

            <h2> Write Every Day</h2>
            <p>
                Every craft takes practice to become truly proficient, and writing is no exception. Unless you are one of a few very fortunate people, you will not become an award-winning author by accident. 

                One top writing tip is simply to write as regularly as you can. This helps you exercise the part of your brain responsible for your writing prowess. 
                
                So, how can you do this?
                
                Writing every day does not mean churning out thousand-word-long articles. If you want to become a better writer, a great way to get going is to write just a little but often. 
                
                It can provide a ton of practice while you’re waiting for your workload to pick up. 
                
                Try committing to a “write every day” challenge to improve your discipline. Platforms like WriteEveryDay.app are a great starting point for that goal
